# Exploring-AI-Bias-Through-SHAP-Based-Interpretation-of-a-Machine-Learning-Model
This project investigates bias in AI models by training an XGBoost classifier on data generated by two different AI systems (ChatGPT and DeepSeek) and interpreting their predictions using SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) values. The analysis explores how various features contribute to biased outcomes and discusses strategies to mitigate them.
